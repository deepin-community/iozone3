Description: Filesystem and Disk Benchmarking Tool
 Iozone is useful for determining a broad benchmark of filesystem 
 performance. The benchmark tests file I/O performance for the
 following operations: Read, write, re-read, re-write, read backwards, 
 read strided, fread, fwrite, random read/write, pread/pwrite variants.
